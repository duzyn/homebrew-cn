  # The app's auto-updater avoids versions marked as "pre-release" on GitHub,
  # so we do the same thing in this check.
  # See: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/pull/145753#issuecomment-1521465815
  # We specifically check the GitHub releases page with the `prerelease:false`
  # query (instead of using the `GithubReleases` strategy) because upstream
  # publishes a lot of pre-release versions and they may push the most recent
  # stable desktop release out of the most recent info from the GitHub API.
