  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      ruby-build installs a non-Homebrew OpenSSL for each Ruby version installed and these are never upgraded.

      To link Rubies to Homebrew's OpenSSL 1.1 (which is upgraded) add the following
      to your shell profile e.g. ~/.profile or ~/.zshrc:
        export RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-openssl-dir=$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)"

      Note: this may interfere with building old versions of Ruby (e.g <2.4) that use
      OpenSSL <1.1.
